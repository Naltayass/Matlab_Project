This study aims specifically to visualize a high dimensional data set and conduct three different
dimensionality reduction analysis on it. For data visualization targets, we will employ various
visualization techniques, such as histogram, bar plot, box plot, bar chart, scatter plot both in 2-D
and 3-D, to inspect and present data structure and mutual relationships. The visualization starts
from single categorical and numerical variables, and moves up to pairwise variables, triple
variables and quadruple variables. Analysis will be given based on correspondent plots. After
visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and
Multidimensional Scaling techniques will be employed to reduce numerical data dimensionality.

The Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset (online_shoppers_intention.csv) is a publicly
